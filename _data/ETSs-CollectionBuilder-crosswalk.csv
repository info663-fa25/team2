etd_0001,Encouraging Ethical Behaviour through Design: A design process,,Master's Thesis,pdf,en,Mallaa A. Alamoudi,"The phrase social responsibility appears with the word design because of the visual
power of design to publicize information and knowledge. Design and social responsibility is a
controversial topic in the filed of graphic design because some designers prefer to stay neutral
toward social topics around them while other designers encourage utilizing the visual power of
design to solve and promote social issues for the purpose of change. Above all, Design and
social responsibility is usually limited by three areas: green design, designing for charitable
organizations and reframing from designing for companies that either through the process or
from their final product do harm to people. In my design work, supported by the investigation
of the operational terms of the problem, the articulation of the research question and objectives,
the introductory sketching phase, the visual research, the design approaches and the user testing
feedback demonstrate a design process that can be utilized by others in the practice of design to
be more socially responsible. The findings and outcomes of this research aim to create a
practical guide for designers, design students and individuals interested in the filed of design and
social responsibility.",2016,Design; Social change,,https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/bitstreams/dffbe1b4-227f-4958-8014-bbc1402f65a7/download,,"© Mallaa Alamoudi, 2016",Master of Design,Masters,Design,"York University (Toronto, Ont.)"
etd_0002,Handcraft as a Rhetorical Prop: An Investigation into What Handcraft Techniques Offer the Discipline of Graphic Design.,,Master's Thesis,pdf,en,Saskia van Kampen,"This thesis paper examines how handcraft (making an item by analog means using specific materials)
can be a compelling rhetorical tool for graphic designers to harness. Contrasting handcraft techniques
with computer graphics software “unsettles” rote graphic design practices. The meaning that
lies in the physical act of making, the materials that are used and the contexts with which particular
handcrafts are associated can support, as well as carry, visual rhetoric in design works.
An analysis of the unconventional handcraft work produced by Stefan Sagmeister (USA), Mathias
Augustyniak and Michaël Amzalag of M/M (Paris) (France), Marian Bantjes (Canada), and by this
author (specifically, a design book produced in tandem with this paper) is used to demonstrate how
complex meanings contained within handcrafts can be revealed and used in graphic design. The
combination of handcraft and digital techniques enables designers to interweave the disparate social,
physical and material qualities of the two processes into their work. In this way the work engages in
disciplinary and societal discourse.",2014,Handicraft; Visual communication; Graphic arts—Social aspects,David Cabianca (Supervisor); Sandra Gabriele,https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/bitstreams/4968ded7-7187-4457-bc65-d7a1ad1f9236/download,,"© Saskia van Kampen, 2014",Master of Design,Masters,Design,"York University (Toronto, Ont.)"

etd_0004,Building Character through Type,,Master's Thesis,pdf,en,Eli Marco Hall,"Typography, the art of designing with type began in the West around 1455 when
Johannes Gutenberg perfected the craft of printing from individual pieces of type.
Typography is the graphic designer’s domain. It is the vehicle that clearly communicates
a message. The expectations of designers are increasingly broadened, and as a result less
time is given to understanding the craft. In my professional experience typography has
broken down into five specific categories: calligraphy, hand lettering, type design, print
design and digital design. Calligraphy is the art of writing, while hand lettering is the art
of crafting specific characters for a particular goal. Type design is the creation of an
alphabet including all of its characters numbers and glyphs. Print design ranges from
movable type to any type where the intended output is print, whereas digital design has
been created specifically for digital use. Today’s designers are exposed to digital type
from the beginnings of their educations. The lack of working, creating and experiencing
type in the physical realm combined with the access to thousands of poorly designed
typefaces has muddied the understanding of type. In this work, my intent is to expand
my knowledge of typography through hand lettering combined with site-specific
installations. Within the field of graphic design, typography is the most important
element and the hardest to master, therefore it is imperative to learn type through a
tactile process. The information you receive through a physical relationship is
substantially different than the insight you would receive through an abstract experience.",2011,Visual communication; Lettering; Calligraphy; Graphic design (Typography),John Gravdahl (Advisor); Cyane Tornatzky (Co-Advisor); Thomas Lundberg; Eleanor Moseman; Donna Rouner; Gary Voss,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstreams/b732e985-79c9-46aa-bd75-9a6796f4d381/download,,"Copyright by Eli Marco Hall 2011All Rights Reserved",Master of Fine Arts,Masters,Fine Arts,Colorado State University

Past research into temporal typography has focused on changing the size, orientation, color, and position of typographic forms while keeping the letterforms themselves intact. This thesis proposes pliant type as an area of study within temporal typography in which letterforms are malleable shapes which can move in expressive ways. This thesis presents a shape representation for type which allows the manipulation of typographic shapes on a basic level. Two shape representations have been imple-mented: outline and skeletal. In pliant type design experiments, letterforms are created using a shape builder. These shapes then are manipulated through interaction with the user and with computational engines. Pliant type suggests new ideas for expressive visual communica-tion.

etd_0010,Developing a practice-led framework to promote the practise and understanding of typography across different media,,Doctoral Dissertation,pdf,en,Joyce Sheau Roei Yee,"This study presents a pedagogic framework that offers a new approach, structure and content for the teaching, understanding and application of typography in cross-media communication environments. Current theory and vocabulary used to describe typographic practice and scholarship are based on a historically print-derived framework. As yet, no new paradigm has emerged to address the divergent path that screen-based typography has taken from its traditional print medium. This study argues that the current model of typographic education is unable to provide design students with appropriate models, concepts and grammar to explore the potential of typography in screen-based media. Hence, a re-evaluation of the current framework is proposed in order to develop new approaches that will reduce misappropriation of typographic principles and aesthetic values in screen-based media.

This study is composed of three research stages. Stage One (consisting of a literature and design application review) was used to develop an understanding of the current typographic application in screen-based media. Stage Two (consisting of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews) was used to investigate the relevance of current typographic knowledge in relation to screen-based media. Additionally, this stage helped identify critical issues surrounding current and future typographic practice. Findings from Stages One and Two were used as a basis to develop a new framework. This framework was subsequently tested and refined in Stage Three through action research projects (with Graphic and New Media design students) and peer reviews (with design educators and professional practitioners). The final framework consists of six key attributes: an integrated model of knowledge, cross-media skills, cross-disciplinary influences, it is communication-focused, flexible and adaptable. It reflects a future model of a convergent media, not a continued separation of print and screen. This framework consists of two distinct areas of knowledge: Global Skills (Form, Content, Expression and Context) and Specialist Skills (Hyper-textuality, Interactivity, Temporality and Usability).

It is concluded that the approach and knowledge-base used to teach typography must be modified to reflect the challenges posed by media convergence, where transferable global skills are emphasised across a range of media. Typography's knowledge base has to be expanded to include specialist skills derived from technological and social changes in communication technologies. The principal contributions of the study are: the identification of transferable global typographic skills; the introduction of specialist design skills required for effective cross-media type application; presentation of an integrated model of typographic knowledge and practice; a curriculum guide aimed at helping design educators plan and deliver typography in graphic and multimedia programmes, strategies and approaches to help designers remediate their print-derived knowledge and lastly, as a subject reference guide for visual communication design students.

The framework is not offered as an absolute representation of western-based typographic knowledge for cross-media application but instead should be considered as a signpost to help understand the current transition of knowledge between print and screen. Additionally, this framework has been developed and tested within a single educational environment. As a result, variations in teaching and learning styles were not taken into account. Audiences are urged to treat the framework as a 'work-in-progress' model that can be refined through additional field-testing in other educational environments. And finally, the application of the framework within a professional practice environment would require a comprehensive review of practice-based concerns and a further simplification of the framework.",2006,Graphic design (Typography); Graphic arts—Social aspects; Graphic arts—History—20th century,Robert Young (Principal Supervisor); Ted Carden (Subject Supervisor),https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/177390025/JoyceYeeThesisUNN,Northumbria Research Link,© Joyce Sheau Roei Yee,Doctor of Philosophy,Doctorate,Philosophy,University of Northumbria at Newcastle

overwhelming physical presence is pervasive. If language, to some degree, is involved in the
formation of the subject, I aim to demonstrate the role typography plays in the formation and
re-formation of subjectivities within the realm of consumption in late-capitalist societies.
This research emphasises Marxist feminist standpoints in order to study typography
in its commodity form. Undertaking a critical analysis of typography and the context in which
it has been marketed and sold, I intend to problematise the fetishisation of language and
interrogate its sociomaterial relations as expressions of commodity feminism within a
postfeminist landscape. This thesis takes as its object of study not only the letterforms in
question, but also the conditions in which they are produced, as well as the assumed
intentions of the producers. A distinct focus on typography is necessary to understand the
ways in which one’s constitution is shaped through messaging received in a commodified
environment. Further to the image of the letterform this research also studies the materials
deployed to give these letters form, specifically within a visual merchandising environment,
to understand how these materials further intensify the message. In highlighting the
performative gestures of typography and language through a critical study, this research

Se adoptó un enfoque exploratorio y descriptivo que abarcó el análisis de portadas representativas de siete subgéneros: Swing, Bebop, Hard Bop, Cool Jazz, Free Jazz, Jazz Fusión y Smooth Jazz. Cada subgénero fue conceptualizado mediante la identificación de tres características clave, derivadas de una revisión de literatura especializada y fuentes oficiales, que describen sus atributos sonoros y emocionales. Estas características fueron contrastadas con elementos tipográficos como morfología, peso, estilo y contexto histórico, evaluando si las decisiones visuales reflejan las particularidades culturales y estilísticas de cada subgénero. La metodología incluyó una revisión bibliográfica, análisis visual de portadas y categorización de patrones tipográficos en relación con atributos sonoros específicos. Los resultados revelan una ausencia de correlación directa entre las tipografías y los subgéneros, lo que sugiere una desconexión entre la identidad visual y sonora del jazz. Este hallazgo destaca la influencia de tendencias históricas y culturales amplias en las elecciones tipográficas, en lugar de una representación específica de cada estilo musical.

etd_0017,Typographic emphasis of headings: Methods of typographic emphasis to assist with search of unfamiliar and familiar text,,Doctoral Dissertation,pdf,en,Claire Timpany,"Readers use headings to understand the structure and content of a text, and to locate information. Readers understand the structure of a text by building an understanding of the structure of the content through developing relationships between the sections of content. Headings assist readers with both their comprehension of text as well as assisting them with recall of the content. Headings provide signals to readers to aid navigation of a document by indicating the structure of topics. This helps readers locate information either by signalling unfamiliar content or by providing markers that support recall of where information appears in a familiar text. The importance of headings is known; however, little research exists to indicate how these organisational features should be presented visually. This research was undertaken to address that gap in understanding. Five studies were carried out to investigate which heading emphasis methods are most easily identified within a passage of text and which methods best assist readers when searching through text. An initial survey of current practice showed six main methods for emphasising headings, often used in combination to create stronger emphasis. The survey also revealed that the same publication frequently presents headings inconsistently across print and digital formats. These findings helped determine which emphasis methods were included in the paired comparison studies. Three paired comparison studies were then conducted to establish which typographic emphasis methods are most easily identified within a passage of text. Seven individual emphasis methods were compared in print and on screen, followed by comparisons of five combined emphasis methods in both media. These studies found that methods with the greatest visual weight were most easily identified. The most easily identifiable heading styles were then evaluated in search tasks to determine which of four heading styles offered the most help when readers searched for answers in screen-based text. The research showed that headings created by combining two emphasis methods are more distinct from the surrounding body text. These clearer headings are more useful when readers search for information, whether the text is new to them or already familiar. When bold is paired with either increased size or a sans serif typeface, readers are able to locate information more quickly and accurately, regardless of their familiarity with the document.",2018,Visual communication; Layout (Printing); Graphic arts,Dr. Sally Jo Cunningham (Chief Supervisor); Dr. Lyn Hunt (Second Supervisor),https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/12091/thesis.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,Research Commons at the University of Waikato,"Copyright Statement: The digital copy of this thesis is protected by the Copyright Act 1994 (New Zealand).
